# Montreal POI Geospatial Analysis

## Introduction

This project analyzes and visualizes the Points of Interest (POI) in Montreal. It covers various steps including data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), geospatial visualizations, clustering, and interactive visualizations. Census data is also integrated to provide deeper insights.

## Data Loading and Preparation

- Loaded and cleaned POI and census data from CSV files.
- Handled missing values and duplicates.
- Aggregated POI data by arrondissement and merged it with census data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conducted frequency analysis for POIs by family, category, and arrondissement.
- Visualized geospatial distribution with scatter plots.

## Geospatial Visualization
